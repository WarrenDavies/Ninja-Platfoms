# Ninja-Platfoms
A simple platform game

## The Concept

This is a very simple yet relaxing climbing game. A ninja with an unusually large head climbs indefinitely up a gravity-defying series of platforms, collecting coins and killing beasts along the way.

In the background the sun set, night falls, and morning breaks.

Baddies get tougher the higher you get.

Get as high as you can before you die.

That's it!

## How to Play

Controls:

* w = jump 
* a  = left 
* s = drop while jumping
* d = right
